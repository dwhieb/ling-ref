The volume is relevant not only to researchers in language endangerment, language shift and language death, but to anyone interested in the languages and cultures of the world. It is accessible both to specialists and non-specialists: researchers will find cutting-edge contributions from acknowledged experts in their fields, while students, activists and other interested readers will find a wealth of readable yet thorough and up-to-date information."

  "abstract": "Syncretism – where a single form serves two or more morphosyntactic functions – is a persistent problem at the syntax–morphology interface. It results from a ‘mismatch’ whereby the syntax of a language makes a particular distinction, but the morphology does not. This pioneering book provides the first full-length study of inflectional syncretism, pre- senting a typology of its occurrence across a wide range of languages. The implications of syncretism for the syntax–morphology interface have long been recognized: it argues either for an enriched model of feature structure (thereby preserving a direct link between function and form), or for the independence of morphological structure from syntactic structure. This book presents a compelling argument for the autonomy of morph- ology, and the resulting analysis is illustrated in a series of formal case studies within Network Morphology. It will be welcomed by all linguists interested in the relation between words and the larger units of which they are a part."

As a result of this circular, many of the earliest attested sources of Native languages of the United States consist of a Jefferson list, including the Chitimacha. Martin Duralde acquired a translation of the words on the Jefferson list into Chitimacha in 1802. Enclosed notes are a comparative vocabulary (possibly Jefferson's), as well as a list of verbal forms and sentences. The letter recommends using 'the plan proposed by Mr. Pickering' for orthography, but asks respondents to accompany their list with a key to the phonetics as well. A third enclosure is Gallatin's attempt to 'arrange the dialects' according to language. This would be his 1828[?] publication.",

Three different perspectives are presented: a long view of phonology, from ancient to modern traditions; an areal and genetic view of sound patterns, and their relation to theory and description; and a practical perspective on the importance of research on endangered sound patterns. All perspectives converge on a common theme: the most lasting and influential contributions to the field are those with seamless boundaries between description and analysis."

  "abstract": "The present volume aims to familiarize interested readers with the extent and variation of the accelerating phenomena of language endangerment. They will find global overviews on endangered languages in chapters dealing with all major geographic regions of the world. These contribu- tions provide insights into the specific areal dynamics of language endan- germent, past and present. In addition, the authors discuss numerous key issues concerning the documentation of endangered languages. This book is aimed not only at scholars and students from the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, but also addresses issues that are relevant to educators, lan- guage planners, policy makers, language activists, historians and other re- searchers in human science. The volume comprises updated versions of presentations from the Colloquium Language Endangerment, Research and Documentation Setting Priorities for the 21st Century held in Bad Godesberg from Feb- ruary 12th17th, 2000 and sponsored by the Volkswagen Foundation. Be- sides the present publication, the colloquium had a substantial impact on the genesis of the UNESCO report Language Vitality and Endanger- ment, as well as the Recommendations for Action Plans. Between 2001 and 2003, a UNESCO ad-hoc expert group on endangered languages (co-chaired by Akira Yamamoto and Matthias Brenzinger) collaborated with the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Section in Paris to draft a preliminary version."

  "abstract": "The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics provides a state-of-the-art survey of this well-established ? eld of linguistics. Thanks to recent technological advances and the rise in availability of large-scale datasets, the importance of diachrony as a key to understanding human language has been reinforced. This Handbook unites an international group of scholars with expertise in a range of ? elds relating to the study of language change, and their chapters encompass: • an overview of the main current and critical trends • the methods which underpin current work • an analysis of the relationship between the diachronic and synchronic study of the topic • models of language change • examples from primary data • the importance of historical linguistics for other sub? elds of linguistics and other disciplines. Focusing on the synthesis of work on synchrony and diachrony and bringing together diverse aspects of work that relate to language change, this Handbook is essential reading for researchers and postgraduate students working in this area."

At the end of the letter is is a list of drawings of the different patterns of basket, along with their Chitimacha name and English translation. The transcription of the Chitimacha is English-based.<br/><br/>The text of the letter is as follows:<br/><br/>&quot;My dear Miss Nicholson,<br/><br/>Let me thank you for your letter and the check for $35.00 in payment of the next of twelve double weave box shape baskets, made by old Clara Darden, of the Chetimaches Indians. She is the oldest indian[?] of her her tribe being nearly 100 years old with but one eye and one tooth. So it is not often that she feels well enough to work on her baskets, and she was more than a year making this next of 12 baskets. In 1901 when I began this Indian work, Old Clara was the only woman in the tribe who could make a perfect basket. There were two or three who had learned when they were younger but had not made any baskets for years as there was no demand for them, and they knew nothing of shipping[?] them, so they no longer made any. When my friend [Hlm?] F. K.[?] Doubleday of New York offered 15.00 to be divided into three prizes for the first perfect basket made by any of the Chetimaches women or girls. I undertook to see it done, and had old Clara Darden show them what kinds of reed cane to gather then how to split the cane. (they split it with their <u>teeth</u> when I asked old Clara how she could do it with only one tooth she said her gums were so hard she split it with them.) then what roots to gather and how to make with them the red, yellow, &amp; black dyes, then how to dye the cane, and then how to weave [things?] beautiful double &amp; single weave baskets with their many beautiful patterns on them, all them[?], this old woman taught the young women and girls. and it is for that reason that I am so [???] that her work should be placed in one of the large museums, with her name on it and a card telling what <u>she</u> has done for her tribe that she has in teaching the young women, preserved for them a most beautiful art that is all their own, that has been handed down to them from time immemorial by their ancestors. The Indian line on the Bayou Teche, when the first white people found them with a large village, and their large tract of land which surrounded their village was granted by Spain &amp; France, and confirmed by the U.S.A. at the &quot;Treaty of Paris.&quot; all in recognition of their services to the colonists. I am sending you under separate cover a photograph of Clara Darden at work splitting the canes. After splitting them with her hands as she is doing in the picture, she with her teeth peels off the out side of the cane, &amp; that is what she makes her baskets of. The photograph is [5-0??] etc. I have made out a list of I think (or nearly as I can remember) the 12 patterns on the next of baskets with their indian name and meaning. If any of these patterns are not on the baskets, make an out line of the pattern that is, and send it to me &amp; I will send you its name and meaning.<br/><br/>I am very sorry you were disappointed in the large [han?pen?]. and I don't see how you could have &quot;believed them half the size and double weave,&quot; as I wrote you giving a [non?le] sketch of their shape. and exact measurement of each. The only <u>large</u> <u>double</u> weave basket the Chetimaches make is trunk shape with canes 25in long 18in high 17in wide price 30.00. Old Clara has with another woman made two of them since I have started the work and [she made for me] [hone?] the other is sold. I hope all this will help you in selling the rest of baskets to some museums. With good wishes for your work. Very sincerely,<br/><br/>Mary M. Bradford<br/>(Mrs. Sidney Bradford)",

Thus the only loanword that Brown found in Chitimacha was actually borrowed from the northwest rather than the east, as most borrowings in the region were.

Allowing for idiosyncrasies of early spelling conventions, the historical evidence demonstrates not only remarkable consistency with modern record- ings of Mobilian Jargon and with comparative data for related source lan- guages, but also the feasibility of systematic philological reconstructions or reconstitutions by triangulation. The vocabulary shows considerable lexical richness with a diversity of semantic domains, confirming multiple usages and manifold social contexts for the pidgin, as indicated by historical and ethno- graphic data. Its lexicon further reveals substantial etymological variation, re- flecting contributions from the speakers' diverse first languages, and lends support to a multilectal interpretation of Mobilian Jargon, including the lingua franca Creek of colonial Alabama and Georgia."

In Chitimacha, this shift involved the change in meaning of <i>nanu</i> from 'apple' to 'persimmon', so that 'apple' is now <i>nanu qatin</i> 'large persimmon'. The data used appear to come from Gatschet (1883) and Swanton (1919).",
  "private_publication": false,
  "abstract": "Across the southeastern United States, native American languages have linguistically accommodated the European-introduced peach by referring to it through the use of respective terms for the native plum. This has taken the form of marking reversals in which native words originally designating plum have shifted in reference to peach, with modified (overtly marked) 'peach' terms used to denote plum (e.g., 'little peach'= plum). Marking reversals were moti- vated throughout the region by a radical change in the relative cultural im- portance of the two referents, wherein the introduced peach surpassed the native plum in salience. The broad distribution of this nomenclatural feature is probably attributable both to diffusion and to independent development. Other widespread features involving words for introduced items are noted including a marking reversal in which the introduced pig and the native opossum are nomenclaturally linked. These lexical traits suggest the southeastern United States to be a post-contact linguistic area."

Chief Paul's wife, Mrs. Christine Paul, and his niece, Mrs. Delphine Ducloux, also assisted. None of the people Densmore interviewed were able to recall any Chitimacha songs, but she did record a number of traditions and stories (in English).

  "abstract": "Devices used to mark questions and certain types of tab questions in 79 random randomly chosen languages are examined in terms of features of intonation and word accent, order and segmental elements as well as parameters of expected response (yes-no, information, alternative questions) and of grammatical domain (word, sentence). Intonation in yes-no questions typically consists of a rising or higher-pitched or -stressed terminal contour, always in prepositional languages and nearly always in postpositional. The same is true of information questions but to a lesser extent. Question words generally tend to be marked by higher pitch or greater stress, particularly in SOV languages. Yes-no-question inversion results in VSO constituent order. In information-question inversion question words are almost always sentence-initial in SVO and VSO languages, while in SOV languages there is a tendency to maintain neutral declarative order. These favored orders reflect topicalization of the verb in yes-no questions and of the nonverbal constituent in information questions. Question particles are usually sentence-initial or -final, the latter especially in SOV languages. There appear to be no general restrictions on the cooccurrence of question particles with either interrogative inversion or question words. Most tag questions contain negative markers. The response to a confirmation-requesting tag question generally mirrors the affirmative or negative mode of the declarative portion of the question, thus reaffirming its truth value."
