    "notes": "Mithun presents numerous potential cases of lexical flexibility at the root, stem, and fully-inflected word levels in Central Alaskan Yup'ik, and argues that these items are specified for lexical category in each case, and therefore should not be considered flexible. As a diagnostic for identifying lexical flexibility, Mithun notes that zero-derivation presupposes a basic/derived relationship, even if diachronically, whereas polycategoriality assumes a single abstract meaning. In the case of polycategoriality, more specific meanings in different constructions must be accounted for.<br/><br/>Mithun presents the following arguments in favor of zero-derivation for seemingly flexible forms in Yup'ik:<br/><br/>* Most roots are only used as nouns or verbs. 35% are nominal, 53% are verbal, and only 12% may be used as both.<br/><br/>* There are no semantic commonalities to which roots may be used for which function. The possible uses of a root must be memorized on a lexeme-specific basis.<br/><br/>* The semantic relationships between roots being used for different functions are not predictable, suggesting that the items in each pair constitute separate lexical items.<br/><br/>* The same kinds of semantic relationships hold between homophonous roots as appear in derived stems. Some roots can alternate classes with no derivation, while others cannot. This suggests that homophonous roots are actually the result of zero-derivation.<br/><br/>* Yup'ik derivational affixes are fully specified for both the lexical catgory they attach to and the lexical category that results. If two meanings are possible for a root, a derivational affix will utilize the meaning most prototypical to the category it selects for.<br/><br/>* Despite homophony between nominal and verbal uses of fully-inflected words, the two categories have different syntactic distributions.<br/><br/>* The homophony between nominal and verbal fully-inflected words is the result of insubordination and other diachronic processes.",

    "abstract": "The possibility of polycategorial lexical items, unspecified for category, raises interesting issues. One is the predictability of semantic relationships between polycategorial forms in predicating and referring uses. Another is the language- internal generality of the phenomenon, whether it necessarily holds of all units at a particular level. A third is its cross-linguistic generality and potential association with certain typological features. These issues are examined with examples from a language exhibiting striking similarities to the Mayan languages for which polycategoriality has recently been argued. Central Alaskan Yup’ik Eskimo appears to show robust polycategoriality at the root, stem, word, and clause level. A closer look indicates that the story is actually more interesting, and that the universality of polycategoriality remains an open question."

    "notes": "Swadesh’s Ph.D. dissertation at Yale under Edward Sapir, this work provides a description of word structure and lexical semantics in Nuuchahnulth (a.k.a. Nootka; Wakashan). Swadesh famously makes the claim that “Normal words [in Nuuchahnulth] are all verbal in fundamental nature” (p. iv), and that they are all of one type (i.e. a single lexical category). However, Swadesh also notes various selectional restrictions for certain affixes which partition the lexicon, such as a strict separation between suffixes which may attach to numeral stems vs. non-numeral stems (p. 112), or that certain suffixes require a “substantive” stem (p. 113). As such, Swadesh's categorization of the lexicon is based on semantic meaning, and comprises the following: substantive (entity), state, action, location, time, quantity, and specification (indication). Swadesh partitions the lexicon in this way on the basis of the existence of a set of seven “special reference stems” which express these categories, and assumes that these stems represent a fundamental set of categories in the lexicon, despite there being no formal evidence elsewhere in the language. (Here, Swadesh anticipates what Levinson &amp; Burenhult (2009) refer to as a semplate, or a semantic template that operates in more than one area of the grammar.) Swadesh also discusses various idiosyncrasies in the lexicon, in particular *implicit derivation* and *specialization*. In implicit derivation, a derived stem takes on a meaning that is more than the sum of its parts, e.g. a derived form that literally means ‘knife in hand’ is in actual practice used to mean ‘having a knife in hand’ (p. iv; pp. 43ff.). Some of these cases fall into classes of regular patterns, and others are idiosyncratic. By specialization, Swadesh refers to the use of a derived stem to refer to something more specific than the meaning of its parts implies, e.g. the use of a form literally meaning ‘big creature’ to mean ‘whale’ (p. 54). Like implicit derivation, some cases of specialization follow certain general patterns, while others are idiosyncratic.",

    "abstract": "In Nootka, it is necessary to distinguish the word as a lexical unit from the word as a syntactic unit. The lexical word is a close-knit phonetic and semantic unit built out of a stem and any number of formative suffixes. As used in the sentence, the word may have the form of the basic lexical unit or may consist of the latter with the addition of any number of incremental suffixes which are phonetically and, to a certain extent, semantically distinguishable from formative suffixes.\\n\\nIncremental suffixes have the function of rounding out the word into a predication or otherwise preparing it for its function in the sentence; they express ideas of time, voice, mode, and person. Formative suffixes have the function of building up the lexical or unextended word on the basis of the stem; they include aspect formatives and derivational suffixes.\\n\\nFormal word types (parts of speech) in Nootka are two: particles and normal words. Particles include syntactic, imperative, and interjectional elements; they are characterized by a simple structure, a lack of aspect implication, and a limited capacity for extension by means of incremental suffixes. Normal words are all verbal in fundamental nature; they are formally characterized by a potentially polysynthetic structure, a definite aspect implication, and unlimited capacity for extension by means of incremental suffixes.\\n\\nThe unextended word is semantically a potential predication concerning the potential subject of the word. (The term \"subject of the word\" is justified in Nootka because subject pronouns in the form of incremental suffixes are attachable to any normal word.) Some words constitute a unified potential predication, others a compound potential predication, depending on the type of derivational suffix employed in the construction of the word. Thus, ther is one type of suffix that always makes the word into a unified potential predication; suffixes of this type may be called governing suffixes. Another type of suffix sets a secondary potential predication alongside the original one and builds thus a compound potential predication; suffixes of this type may be called restrictive suffixes.\\n\\nThe units in derivation are the underlying theme and the derivational suffix and the meaning of the derived form is a function of the meaning of these two units. To understand the semantics of derivation in Nootka, it is necessary to classify underlying themes and derivational suffixes according to semantic content. To this purpose, the following semantic classes are proposed: substantive (e.g., \"to be a house\"), state (e.g., \"to be erect\"), action (e.g., \"to jump\"), location (e.g., \"to be in the houes\"), time (e.g., \"to be at night\"), quantity (e.g., \"to be three\"), specification (e.g., \"to be this one\"). It is important to note that these are semantic and not formal classes; for, aside from particles, there is only one formal class, essentially verbal. The classification holds for derivational suffixes as well as themes except that the distinction bewteen governing and restrictive derivational suffixes is of even more fundamental importance. In addition to themes belonging to one or another of these classes, there are restricted themes (built up by means of restrictive suffixes and expressing compound potential predications) belonging to two or more semantic classes at once.\\n\\nThe derivational economy of Nootka tends on the whole to be mechanical in nature, but two interfering processes need to be recognized: implicit derivation and specialization. By implicit derivation, a theme takes on the meaning of a derivative of that theme (e.g., \"knife in the hand\" is used for \"having a knife in the hand\"). By specialization, a theme that should have a general reference is used to refer to something more particular (e.g., \"big creature\" is the regular expression for \"whale\"). While specialization and some instances of implicit derivation are sporadic and unpredictable, there are certain types of implicit derivation that are actually or almost regular."

    "abstract": "Most linguists who have investigated linguistic categories from a universal viewpoint have accepted the existence of two basic parts of speech, *noun* and *verb*. Other categories are found to be only inconsistently represented; thus *adjective* is manifested in many languages as a class of stative verb. Furthermore, individual languages often have intermediate categories such as *gerund*, which cannot be unambiguously assigned to a single category. We suggest here that the basic categories N and V are to be viewed as universal lexicalizations of the prototypical discourse functions of 'discourse-manipulable participant' and 'reported event', respectively. We find that the grammars of languages tend to label the categories N and V with morphosyntactic markers which are iconically characteristic of these categories to the degree that a given instance of N or V approaches its prototypical function. In other words, the closer a form is to signaling this prime function, the more the language tends to recognize its function through morphemes typical of the category—e.g. deictic markers for N, tense markers for V. We conclude by suggesting that categoriality itself is another fundamental property of grammars which may be directly derived from discourse function."

Among the topics treated are phonological characteristics such as syllable structure, vowel and consonant harmony, tonal patterns, and sound symbolism; morphological issues such as the nature of polysynthesis, the functions of roots and affixes, incorporation, and morpheme order; grammatical distinctions of number, gender, shape, control, space, means, manner, time, empathy, and evidence; structural distinctions between nouns and verbs, predicates and arguments, and simple and complex sentences; the nature of grammatical relations; and special speech styles such as those used with children, those attributed to men or women, narrative and ceremonial language, speech play, and Plains Sign Talk. Part II catalogues the languages by family, detailing genetic relationships, the locations and numbers of speakers, major published literature, and structural highlights. Included are languages that have arisen in contact situations: pidgins, creoles, and mixed languages.",

    "abstract": "The genesis of new lexical categories poses a challenge to theories of diachronic change: If there are no pre-existing words in the class to analogize to, how does the category arise? This paper shows that a constructional approach to category change successfully accounts for the genesis of a diverse class of preverbs in Chitimacha, an isolate of the U.S. Southeast linguistic area. It is shown that what enabled the creation of the preverb category was schematization across a variety of forms with similar properties, namely, a preverbal syntactic position and a directional semantics. Category genesis can therefore be viewed as simply a special case of constructionalization wherein schematization plays a crucial role.",

    "abstract": "Chitimacha is a language isolate formerly spoken in southern Louisiana, and is a part of the Southeast linguistic area. Using documentary materials recorded by Morris Swadesh in the 1930s, this talk examines the language-internal evidence for the diachrony of three features of Chitimacha grammar: positional auxiliary verbs, switch-reference, and agent-patient alignment. Each feature is shown to have a clear, language-internal diachronic pathway, wherein existing lexical and grammatical material were recruited for new functions. However, each of these features is shared by other unrelated languages of the Southeast, suggesting that they were in fact motivated by contact. How then did Chitimacha borrow these structural features without borrowing any lexical or grammatical material? The answer, I suggest, is that multilingual speakers in the Southeast carried over discourse-level patterns of managing information flow from other languages, and that as these discourse patterns became more frequent and routinized, they fundamentally reshaped the structure of Chitimacha grammar.",

    "abstract": "This article is a general survey of ‘lexicography,’ the art of writing dictionaries. Dictionaries not only confirm the spelling, meaning, and use of words; they also facilitate the rapid spread of words and ideas. They played an important part in the spread of Renaissance culture, which would not have been possible without the invention of printing. During the Enlightenment (17th and 18th centuries), there was interaction between lexicography and philosophical ideas about language, and the notion grew that a dictionary should record all the words of a language in a consistent fashion. Lexicography in 19th-century Europe was dominated by historical methods in linguistics and saw the birth of some of the great multivolume national dictionaries on historical principles. In the 20th century, another school of lexicography established itself, the purpose of which was explicitly to describe the conventional uses of words in the contemporary language, relegating etymology and archaic senses of words to a subsidiary role. Since the late 1980s, lexicography has begun to respond to the opportunities offered by computer technology, in particular the use of computers to collect and process evidence of word use on a very large scale.",

    "abstract": "Most linguists who have investigated linguistic categories from a universal viewpoint have accepted the existence of two basic parts of speech, NOUN and VERB. Other categories are found to be only inconsistently represented; thus ADJECTIVE is manifested in many languages as a class of stative verb. Furthermore, individual languages often have intermediate categories such as GERUND, which cannot be unambiguously assigned to a single category. We suggest here that the basic categories N and V are to be viewed as universal lexicalizations of the prototypical discourse functions of 'discourse-manipulable participant' and 'reported event', respectively. We find that the grammars of languages tend to label the categories N and V with morpho-syntactic markers which are iconically characteristic of these categories to the degree that a given instance of N or V approaches its prototypical function. In other words, the closer a form is to signaling this prime function, the more the language tends to recognize its function through morphemes typical of the category—e.g. deictic markers for N, tense markers for V. We conclude by suggesting that categoriality itself is another fundamental property of grammars which may be directly derived from discourse function.",

    "title": "NP recursion over time: Evidence from Indo-European",
    "abstract": "Some languages constrain the recursive embedding of NPs to some specific morphosyntactic types, allowing it, for example, only with genitives but not with bare juxtaposition. In Indo-European, every type of NP embedding—genitives, adjectivizers, adpositions, head marking, or juxtaposition—is unavailable for syntactic recursion in at least one attested language. In addition, attested pathways of change show that NP types that allow recursion can emerge and disappear in less than 1,000 years. This wide-ranging synchronic diversity and its high diachronic dynamics raise the possibility that at many hypothetical times in the history of the family recursive NP embedding could have been lost for all types simultaneously, parallel to what has occasionally been observed elsewhere (Everett 2005, Evans & Levinson 2009).\\n\\nPerforming Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on a sample of fifty-five languages from all branches of Indo-European, we show, however, that it is extremely unlikely for such a complete loss to ever have occurred. When one or more morphosyntactic types become unavailable for syntactic recursion in an NP, an unconstrained alternative type is very likely to develop in the same language. This suggests that, while diachronic pathways away from NP recursion clearly exist, there is a tendency—perhaps a universal one—to maintain or develop syntactic recursion in NPs. A likely explanation for this evolutionary bias is that recursively embedded phrases are not just an option that languages have (Fitch et al. 2005), but they are in fact preferred by our processing system.",

    "title": "A functional grammar of Khatso",
    "abstract": "Khatso (kha⁵⁵tso³¹ 喀卓; also Katso, Kazhuo 卡卓, Gazhuo 嘎桌 and Yunnan Mongolian; ISO 639-3:kaf) is an endangered Ngwi (or Yi) language spoken in Xingmeng, a single farming village in Yunnan, China. Khatso speakers, who number about 5600 people, are descendants of the Mongolian soldiers Kublai Khan brought to Yunnan in the 13th century, and they still identify as Mongolian today. The language has evolved considerably through language contact, however, and is now considered part of the central branch of the Ngwi language family within the Tibeto-Burman phylum.\\nAlmost all of the Khatso are bilingual in Mandarin or the local Yunnan dialect, because that is the only way to communicate with outsiders. Chinese is also the only language used in school and mastering it is necessary to pursue an education or find employment outside the town. Children continue to learn the language, but many parents teach them Chinese first and Khatso second. Moreover, there is no writing system; the language is not supported by print media or technology. As a result, the vitality of the language is eroding rapidly. This dissertation is part of larger project to document Khatso in order to help preserve and revitalize the language.\\nThe research and analysis presented in this dissertation differ significantly from previous efforts to describe the language. In addition to identifying the basic building blocks – phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon – there is an emphasis on capturing Khatso the way it is spoken in daily life. Natural language data were gathered during nearly a year of fieldwork in Xingmeng, via both audio and video recordings, creating a large multimedia corpus of the language. Transcriptions of the recordings formed the foundation for the investigation, which follows a discourse-functional approach to linguistic analysis. As a result, this grammar is the most comprehensive analysis of Khatso yet, providing an in-depth look at the features, structures and systems that interact to comprise this unique language. It is also the first major study of the language in English.\\nKhatso is a tonal language that is both analytic and isolating. The phonology is similar to that of most Ngwi languages, with the exception of its relatively large eight-tone system. Tone sandhi is triggered by a variety of phonological, syntactic and discourse factors. There is very little morphology in the language, and most of the lexicon consists of monosyllabic and disyllabic monomorphemes. There is a rich classifier system, which also marks number and specific reference. Typical word order is SV/APV, though there is a great deal of flexibility in discourse. Simple noun modifiers follow nouns, but relative clauses precede them. Serial verb constructions are frequent, and may describe one- and two-event situations. There is no verbal inflection; the aspectual system is indicated by grammatical particles. There is also no evidential system, but both the interrogative and emphatic marker inventories include morphemes that convey epistemic information.\\nThe most fundamental feature of Khatso is the fact that it is a pragmatics-based language, meaning that verbal semantics and discourse context are often more crucial than syntax in comprehending the language. Topic-comment structures and zero anaphora are frequent, regularly creating utterances in which key information is underspecified or absent. Some constructions, such as pragmatic agent marking, are triggered only when the context is ambiguous. And, many particles and constructions in Khatso are multifunctional, relying on context to clarify meaning. Essentially, syntax sets the stage for several potential interpretations and only the flow of information in a specific utterance points to the correct choice. Moreover, some constructions are only identifiable through contextual analysis, such as the many clause-combining structures that link phrases pragmatically without syntactic integration. Consequently, the discourse-functional approach used here has proven especially useful for painting a comprehensive picture of the Khatso language.",
